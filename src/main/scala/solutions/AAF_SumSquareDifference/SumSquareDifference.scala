   * Optimized solution:
   * Let's see what we are really calculating. Imagine that we are calculating the solution
   * for only the first 3 natural numbers:
   *    sumOfSquares = 1**2 + 2**2 + 3**2
   *    squareOfSums = (1 + 2 + 3) ** 2
   *
   * If we expand the squareOfSums:
   *    squareOfSums = (1 + 2 + 3)*(1 + 2 + 3) = 1*1 + 1*2 + 1*3 + 2*1 + 2*2 + 2*3 + 3*1 + 3*2 + 3*3
   *
   * And then, as we are subtracting squareOfSums to that:
   *    solution = squareOfSums - sumOfSquares
   *      = (1*1 + 1*2 + 1*3 + 2*1 + 2*2 + 2*3 + 3*1 + 3*2 + 3*3) - (1**2 + 2**2 + 3**2)
   *      = 1*2 + 1*3 + 2*1 + 2*3 + 3*1 + 3*2
   *      = (1*2)*2 + (1*3)*2 + (2*3)*2
   *
   * As we can see, a lot of the calculations aren't necessary because they get simplified.
   * Thus, the solution is: the summation of multiplying every number by each number higher than it times two.
